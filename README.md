## Illidari Shadows App

This is the homebase for all things IS! Any devs, feel free to open it up and look around (or fix bugs for me!). Enjoy and happy raiding :)

## Instructions

1. `npm install`
2.0 `npm run-script dev` (for watching local changes)
or
2.1 `npm start` (you'll need to manually reload on local changes)

The application will be running on http://localhost:3000 and serving static assets out of /public.
